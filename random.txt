And I hold within my hand
Of a surf-tormented shore,
But a dream within a dream?How few! yet how they creep
Is all that we see or seem
O God! can I not save

Grains of the golden sand--
Take this kiss upon the brow!
You are not wrong, who deem
Take this kiss upon the brow!
Yet if hope has flown away
Yet if hope has flown away
All that we see or seem
O God! can I not save
O God! can I not grasp
Thus much let me avow--
I stand amid the roar
That my days have been a dream;
Is all that we see or seem
All that we see or seem
In a vision, or in none,

Grains of the golden sand--
Yet if hope has flown away
Take this kiss upon the brow!
While I weep--while I weep!
Is but a dream within a dream.
Thus much let me avow--
I stand amid the roar
O God! can I not save
Take this kiss upon the brow!
Is but a dream within a dream.
And I hold within my hand
Yet if hope has flown away
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
