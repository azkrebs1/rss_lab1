In a vision, or in none,
O God! can I not grasp
Take this kiss upon the brow!

Is but a dream within a dream.
While I weep--while I weep!
Yet if hope has flown away
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And I hold within my hand
How few! yet how they creep
Of a surf-tormented shore,
Is but a dream within a dream.
O God! can I not save
Grains of the golden sand--
That my days have been a dream;
=======
Of a surf-tormented shore,
Of a surf-tormented shore,
That my days have been a dream;
Through my fingers to the deep,
Of a surf-tormented shore,
Is but a dream within a dream.
One from the pitiless wave?
While I weep--while I weep!
Yet if hope has flown away
